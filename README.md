# Introduction:

The key challenges in fraud detection include highly imbalanced datasets and the need for complex, domain-specific feature engineering. For example, features such as transaction frequency between two locations (as illustrated in the figure below showing interactions between sender and beneficiary) can be critical. This repository provides a collection of commonly used feature generation methods, feature engineering techniques, and model training workflows, all streamlined to support the end-to-end pipeline for fraud detection problems.
